All the programs are written in c++.

Makefile: The makefile is "Makefile" under the directory.
To compile all the programs together , just run "make".
To compile individual code , 
run "make mytree.x" , "make mytime.x" and so on.


Note : to run the program use the object file names followed by appropriate parameteres the examples are given below
Prog 1 :
Source code: prog1.cpp
object file : mytree.x
To run: mytree.x dirname or ./mytree.x dirname


Prog2 :
Source code: prog2.cpp
object code : mytime.x
To run: mytime.x commandname or ./mytime.x commandname 

Prog3 :
Source code: prog3.cpp
object code: mymtimes.x 
To run: mymtimes.x dirname or ./mymtimes.x dirname
Note: Please try if mytree.x dirname doesn't work in the case when the project path is not set, add./ in front of the executables.
